# A critical first step: Always import the necessary libraries.
# `requests` will be used to make HTTP requests to the Google Maps API.
# `os` will be used to interact with the operating system, specifically to get our API key.
# `dotenv` helps us load environment variables from a .env file securely.

# Get the Google Maps API key from the environment variables.

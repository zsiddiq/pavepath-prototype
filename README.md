# 🛣️ PavePath: Safety-First Routing Engine

PavePath is a modular, microservice-friendly routing engine that enhances traditional navigation systems with **context-aware safety intelligence**. Designed for real-world deployment in rural, urban, and infrastructure-critical environments, PavePath helps users avoid unsafe routes — from dirt roads, flood zones, to dark streets — while enabling commercial use cases and professional-grade contributions.

---

## 💼 Monetization Intent

PavePath is being developed with commercial applications in mind. While the core engine remains open-source under the MIT license, premium modules and enterprise features will be offered under a **commercial license**.

Monetizable features include:
- Premium routing modules (e.g., wildfire zones, flood alerts)
- Offline deployment packages for infrastructure crews
- Enterprise API access and usage-based billing
- White-label solutions for municipalities and other firms

## 🧠 Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🏡 STR Host Safety | Hosts can warn guests about unsafe access roads or nighttime hazards |
| 🚚 Infrastructure Crews | Route planning for utility trucks avoiding dirt paths and hazard zones |
| 🚶‍♀️ Personal Safety | Nighttime routing that avoids poorly lit or high-risk streets |
| 🛻 Rural Navigation | Smart rerouting around unpaved or seasonal roads |
| 🧱 Municipal Deployment | Local governments can deploy PavePath for public safety routing |

## 🧱 Technology Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|------|------|
| Frontend | React (demo UI), Mapbox GL JS |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python), Node.js (microservices) |
| Routing Engine | OSRM / GraphHopper integration |
| Data Sources | OpenStreetMap, Google Maps API, custom hazard datasets |
| Storage | PostgreSQL + PostGIS |
| Deployment | Docker, Kubernetes (optional), local edge support |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana (optional for enterprise) |

Supported Input Formats
Our route optimization system accepts three types of input formats for location data:

1. Coordinates (Latitude/Longitude)
Format: List of tuples or objects containing latitude and longitude

Example:

python
[(33.8121, -117.9190), (34.0522, -118.2437)]
✅ Recommended for GPS-based systems and precision routing

2. Addresses
Format: List of strings representing physical addresses

Example:

python
["123 Main St, Menifee, CA", "456 Elm St, Los Angeles, CA"]
🔄 Requires geocoding to convert to coordinates before routing

3. Grid IDs
Format: List of custom grid identifiers used in internal mapping systems

Example:

python
["A1", "B3", "C7"]
🗺️ Useful for drone delivery zones, warehouse layouts, or predefined map sectors

🔍 Input Validation Rules
Coordinates must be valid floats within latitude/longitude bounds

Addresses must be non-empty strings; geocoding errors will be flagged

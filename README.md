# 🛣️ PavePath: Safety-First Routing Engine

PavePath is a modular, microservice-friendly routing engine that enhances traditional navigation systems with **context-aware safety intelligence**. Designed for real-world deployment in rural, urban, and infrastructure-critical environments, PavePath helps users avoid unsafe routes — from dirt roads, flood zones, to dark streets — while enabling commercial use cases and professional-grade contributions.

---

## 💼 Monetization Intent

PavePath is being developed with commercial applications in mind. While the core engine remains open-source under the MIT license, premium modules and enterprise features will be offered under a **commercial license**.

Monetizable features include:
- Premium routing modules (e.g., wildfire zones, flood alerts)
- Offline deployment packages for infrastructure crews
- Enterprise API access and usage-based billing
- White-label solutions for municipalities and other firms

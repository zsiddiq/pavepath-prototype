# 🛣️ PavePath: Safety-First Routing Engine

PavePath is a modular, microservice-friendly routing engine that enhances traditional navigation systems with **context-aware safety intelligence**. Designed for real-world deployment in rural, urban, and infrastructure-critical environments, PavePath helps users avoid unsafe routes — from dirt roads, flood zones, to dark streets — while enabling commercial use cases and professional-grade contributions.

---

## 💼 Monetization Intent

PavePath is being developed with commercial applications in mind. While the core engine remains open-source under the MIT license, premium modules and enterprise features will be offered under a **commercial license**.

Monetizable features include:
- Premium routing modules (e.g., wildfire zones, flood alerts)
- Offline deployment packages for infrastructure crews
- Enterprise API access and usage-based billing
- White-label solutions for municipalities and other firms

### 🧱 Modular Build (for Developers)
| User Story | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🧠 Rapid Prototyping | Developers can quickly iterate on hazard scoring modules. |
| 🧩 Reusable Logic Blocks | Core modules (e.g., `input_parser`, `route_optimizer`) are productized. |
| 💡 Cross-Domain Validation | Core logic can be applied to other domains (e.g., STR routing, orchard diagnostics). |

### 🏡 Additional Domain Use Cases
| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🏡 STR Host Safety | Hosts can warn guests about unsafe access roads or nighttime hazards. |
| 🚚 Infrastructure Crews | Utility trucks can avoid dirt paths and hazard zones. |
| 🚶‍♀️ Personal Safety | Nighttime routing avoids poorly lit or high-risk streets. |
| 🛻 Rural Navigation | Smart rerouting around unpaved or seasonal roads. |
| 🧱 Municipal Deployment | Local governments deploy PavePath for public safety routing. |

This version keeps your original README intact but **expands the Use Cases section** to include all the stakeholder groups and user stories we’ve been working on.  

Would you like me to also add a **“Modules → Use Cases” mapping table** (so contributors can see which Python files implement which stories), or keep that in a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md`?

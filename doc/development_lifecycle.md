# 🧱 PavePath Development Lifecycle Tracker

## ✅ Current Progress
- 📁 Repo structure modularized
- ⚠️ Alert engine integrated
- 🖼️ Streamlit UI prototype initialized

## 🛠️ Next Milestones
- 🚧 Replace mock route with real routing engine (e.g. OSRM, Valhalla, or custom logic)
- 🌍 Link surface data from OSM or local GeoJSON
- 🔁 Build reroute logic based on user selection (hazard-aware or preference-based)
- ⭐ Add feedback mechanism to rate road segments (UX + data loop)

## 🧩 Modular Goals
- CLI parity with Streamlit UI
- Secrets management standardized via `.env` and Streamlit Cloud
- Contributor onboarding via `docs/contributors.md`
- Service tiering logic for future monetization

## 🧠 Strategic Notes
- Real-time navigation and rerouting will anchor the free tier
- Feedback loop enables scoring and future ML integration
- Modular alert logic supports scalable service bundles
